#Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enough™ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial), possibly the greatest bigger GIT tutorial..wait..why am I just copying all of this?  Isn't this just a practice page? Can't I put anything I want in here? I'm not just some zombie! **I have thoughts of my own you know!**

After finishing *Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git to be *dangerous*.  This means you'll be able to use GIT to track changes in your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate....zzzzzzz
